# Buddhabrot in C

This is fully working B/W Buddhabrot rendering of Mandelbrot set.

I have tried to do it in "Nebula" colors, but it bacame way too complicated to be done without class-es.

Then I tried to it in C++, but it did not worked well as I expected.

By this reason I "forked" and refactored C++ version to Java here:

Java version is also full functional and may produce "Nebula" colors.
